# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

A beginner-friendly Python game where the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and 10, and the user has to guess it. It gives hints like "Too low" or "Too high" until the correct number is guessed!

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- The computer selects a **random secret number** between 1 and 10.
- The player keeps guessing until they get it right.
- The program gives feedback after each guess:
  - ✅ Correct: Ends the game
  - 🔼 Too high: Try a lower number
  - 🔽 Too low: Try a higher number

---

## 💡 Concepts Used

- `while` loop (infinite loop until correct guess)
- `if-elif-else` for decision making
- `input()` and `int()` for user input
- `random.randint()` to generate the secret number
- Basic variables and condition checking

## 📸 Sample Output

I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10...
Take a guess: 4
Too low! Try again.
Take a guess: 9
Too high! Try again.
Take a guess: 7
You got it! 🎉

## 🧠 Good For

- Python beginners
- Practicing loops and input
- Understanding conditionals
- Building real-world logic in games

---

## ✅ Next Step Ideas

- Add score counting (number of tries)
- Add difficulty levels (1-10, 1-100, etc.)
- Limit the number of attempts (like 5 lives)
